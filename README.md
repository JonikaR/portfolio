## About Me
I am JonikaR, a masters student  of Public Policy and Management: Data ANalytics at Heinz College, Carnegie Mellon University. This is my Public Portfolio.
I am creating this in my Spring 22 course - Telling Stories with Data. 

## What I hope to learn
I am interested to learn more about data visualisations in this course through a few different tools. Having been exposed to a lot of datasets and plots for a couple of years now, I want to learn to critique them and ensure that the visualisations I create or present are appealing at the same time are able to convey the right meaning clearly.

I will be updating this repository with the different assignments I work on in this class and the first one amongst those is to create this online portfolio.
