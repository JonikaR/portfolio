# Step one: find a data visualization  

## Plastic Pollution

Having stayed in multiple cities, I was exposed to different kinds of municipalities. Due to this, from some time I have been interested in learning about plastic usage, the effects of different ways its disposed and sustainable options for a lot of daily usage things.

This inspired me to look for data related to plastic pollution. I liked this data because it was showing the trend over time from 1980 and how plastic disposal has shifted. Since plastic has entered our life in every tiny thing we own, we forget about how its usage has changed over time.

This article talks about a lot of things including - 'how much plastic does the world produce?', 'How much plastic enters the worldâ€™s oceans?', 'How do we dispose of our plastic?' etc.

In this post, I will be critiquing the visualisation used under the heading:

### How do we dispose of our plastic?

#### The following chart talks about share of global plastic waste that is discarded, recycled or incinerated from 1980 through to 2015. How has global plastic waste disposal method changed over time?

# Step two: critique the data visualization

# Step three: wireframe a solution

As per my critiquing, the chart they have used to show the change in plastic disposal methods over time is stacked area graph. It is able to show the ratio of how one category is increasing over other but it is not able to capture the values of each category in a particular year. It would also be confusing for a lot of audience who is not usually exposed to different kinds of data visualizations. 

Therefore, in my wireframe I have used group of column charts in which it can be clearly shown the value of each category every year. The group of column chart makes it easier to read every year indiviually as well.
