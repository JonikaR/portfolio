# Plastic Pollution

Having stayed in multiple cities, I was exposed to different kinds of municipalities. Due to this, from some time I have been interested in learning about plastic usage, the effects of different ways its disposed and sustainable options for a lot of daily usage things.

This inspired me to look for data related to plastic pollution. I liked this data because it was showing the trend over time from 1980 and how plastic disposal has shifted. Since plastic has entered our life in every tiny thing we own, we forget about how its usage has changed over time.

This article talks about a lot of things including - 'how much plastic does the world produce?', 'How much plastic enters the worldâ€™s oceans?', 'How do we dispose of our plastic?' etc.

In this post, I will be critiquing the visualisation used under the heading:

## How do we dispose of our plastic?

### The following chart talks about share of global plastic waste that is discarded, recycled or incinerated from 1980 through to 2015. How has global plastic waste disposal method changed over time?
