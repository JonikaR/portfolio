In the following visualisations I am representing debt-to-GDP ratio of various countries in multiple ways.
Debt-to-GDP ratio measures the gross debt of the general government as a percentage of GDP. It is a key indicator for the sustainability of government finance.

# Visualisation 1 - Working with web-based visualization tools and data 

Here is a bar chart that represents General government debt-to-GDP ratio for the year 2019 across all the countries.

# Visualisation 2 -  Grid Line Chart

I have created here a grid chart of the debt-to-GDP ratio for the years 1995 to 2019 across multiple countries using https://flourish.studio/. A line chart is really helpful to track the change in the ratio for each country over time. A grid line chart will help us to look at changes in multiple countries over time and also help us compare any two countries in terms of debt-to-GDP ratio.

# Visualisation 3 - Grid Streamgraph

Changes over time can be shown by giving emphasis to changing trends. It is used to track movements or extended series that traverses over years or decades. 
Choosing the correct time period in these graphsis very important.

A Streamgraph is a type of areachart which is used when seeing changes in proportions over time is more important than individual values. Here I used the streamgraph to show how the debt-to-GDP ratio is changing across the countries over multiple years. The area covered is able to show that very clearly.

I decided to go with this color for the graph as it is neutral and does not highlight in anyway to any specific country or topic of discussion.
