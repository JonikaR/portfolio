# Visaualisation 1 - Working with web-based visualization tools and data 

Here is a bar chart that represents General government debt-to-GDP ratio for the year 2019 across multiple coutries.
Debt-to-GDP ratio measures the gross debt of the general government as a percentage of GDP. It is a key indicator for the sustainability of government finance.

# Visaualisation 2 -  Grid Line Chart

I have created here a grid chart of the debt-to-GDP ratio for the years 1995 to 2019 across multiple countries using https://flourish.studio/. A line chart is really helpful to track the change in the ratio for each country over time. A grid line chart will help us to look at changes in multiple countries over time and also help us compare any two countries in terms of debt-to-GDP ratio.
