# Impact of COVID-19 on learning outcome in schools

## Project Outline:

With this project I want to bring to attention the impact of school closures during COVID-19 pandemic on students. Due to COVID-19, a lot of countries had shut down their schools to avoid the spread of Corona virus. The schools had been shut during the first and second waves in a lot of countries. In a few laces, schools had been opened up partially with precautions for some students. However, not until recently the schools have been started properly.

### What does this mean for students?
For almost 1.5 years :
- Students lost learning time in school
- Students started spending more time on digital devices
- It decreased their physical activities
- It also decreased their social interactions causing distress to emotional and mental well-being
- It led to sharp losses in learning outcomes especially for students without any kind of digital device

This impact due to school closures will take a long time to recover.

Through this project, I want to share some insights on these impacts using various data visualizations.
