# Impact of COVID-19 on learning outcome in schools

## Project Outline:

The number of children, youth and adults not attending schools or universities because of COVID-19 is soaring. Governments all around the world have closed educational institutions in an attempt to contain the global pandemic.
According to UNESCO monitoring, over 100 countries have implemented nationwide closures, impacting over half of worldâ€™s student population. Several other countries have implemented localized school closures and, should these closures become nationwide, millions of additional learners will experience education disruption.

With this project I want to bring to attention the impact of school closures during COVID-19 pandemic on students. Due to COVID-19, a lot of countries had shut down their schools to avoid the spread of Corona virus. The schools had been shut during the first and second waves in a lot of countries. In a few laces, schools had been opened up partially with precautions for some students. However, not until recently the schools have been started properly.

### What does this mean for students?
For almost 1.5 years :
- Students lost learning time in school
- Students started spending more time on digital devices
- It decreased their physical activities
- It also decreased their social interactions causing distress to emotional and mental well-being
- It led to sharp losses in learning outcomes especially for students without any kind of digital device

This impact due to school closures will take a long time to recover.

Through this project, I want to share some insights on these impacts using various data visualizations. I also intend to highlight some key points on how the duration of the school closures has been directly related to the income-levels in different countries and the vaccination rate. Through this project I would like to conclude the importance of keeping the schools open and increasing the vaccination across all countries to ensure that.

### Method:

To publish this project results, I will be using Shorthand, Tableau and ArcGis. I will be showing some data of multiple countries, for which I will use the choropleth maps that can be created using the GIS techniques on ArcGIS. I will be using Tableau to create charts and visualization that can be embedded in the final output. Through this project I want to get introduced to Shorthand. I will finally publish all the findings on Shorthand. It is a unique tool to publish different articles and it supports various ways of sharing information throiugh different tempelates.


### Data Sources:

I intend to highlight some key points on how the duration of the school closures has been directly related to the income-levels in different countries and the vaccination rate. I am going to use the following public source datasets from different resources including UNESCO and World Bank which have data at world level. THe data sets are dates till Jan 2022.

1) Global school closures COVID-19 by UNESCO (https://data.humdata.org/dataset/global-school-closures-covid19)

2) Covid vaccinations (https://ourworldindata.org/covid-vaccinations)

3) New World Bank country classifications by income level: 2021-2022 (https://datahelpdesk.worldbank.org/knowledgebase/articles/906519-world-bank-country-and-lending-groups)

4) Covid19 and its impact on students by Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/kunal28chaturvedi/covid19-and-its-impact-on-students)
